This script will pull the latest compatibility file from [Github](https://github.com/tfitzmac/resource-capabilities/blob/master/move-support-resources-with-regions.csv) and allow you to check each Azure resource in a tenant to discover if it is supported for Resource Group, Subscription or Region moves.

More info on Azure transfers can also be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/transfer-subscriptions-subscribers-csp).

For move validations please follow this article to make the process a little bit easier - [here](https://faultbucket.ca/2019/10/validate-azure-resource-move-with-rest-api/).
